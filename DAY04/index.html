      <h2>Task 2. Build an ATM Cash Withdrawal System</h2>
      <p>
        Rajan goes to the Axis bank ATM. He enters an amount to withdraw. The
        ATM only allows multiples of 100. Print “Withdrawal successful” if
        valid, otherwise print “Invalid amount”.
      </p>
      <pre style="color: maroon">
        let amount = 850;

        if (amount % 100 === 0) {
            console.log("Withdrawal successful")
        } else {
            console.log("Invalid amount")
        }
      </pre>

      <p style="color: rgb(107, 94, 29); font-weight: bold">
        Result: "Invalid amount" 👇 Check the console log.

      <h2>Task 3. Build a Calculator with switch-case</h2>
      <p>
        Write a simple calculator that takes an operator (+, -, , /, %) as
        input, and performs the operation on two numbers. Print the output on
        the console.
      </p>

      <p style="color: rgb(107, 94, 29); font-weight: bold">

      <h2>Task 4. Pay for your movie ticket</h2>
      <p>Imagine, the INOX charges ticket prices based on age:</p>
      <p>
        • Children (<18 years): $3<br />
        • Adults (18 - 60 years): $10<br />
        • Seniors (60+ years): $8
      </p>
      <p>
        I improved it by adding viewers to calculate the mass price of the
        tickets. Write a program that prints the ticket price based on the
        person’s age.
      </p>

      <p>My pick is viewers = 10; and age = 10</p>
      <p style="color: rgb(107, 94, 29); font-weight: bold">
        Result: 👇 Check the console log.
      </p>
    </div>

    Write a program that prints the zodiac sign(Aries, Taurus, Gemini, etc.)
    based on a person’s birth month. Make it month bases, not date based. Like
    March and April borns are Aries, Aplil and May born are Taurus, and so on.
    Do not use if-else. */
